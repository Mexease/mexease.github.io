    <h2>What are the hats?</h2>
    <p><strong>Edward de Bono’s Six Thinking Hats is a powerful tool for group discussion and individual thinking. Each "hat" represents a different perspective or style of thinking. By metaphorically putting on different hats, people can separate thinking into six distinct categories—helping improve focus, collaboration, and innovation.</strong></p>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h2>The Blue Hat</h2>
    <p><strong>The Blue Hat is the thinking about thinking hat. It helps manage and direct the overall process of problem-solving or decision-making. Entrepreneurs wearing this hat are like facilitators or conductors—they set the agenda, determine which hats to use and when, and summarize what has been learned. This hat brings structure, ensuring that the discussion remains focused, balanced, and goal-oriented. It emphasizes clarity, reflection, and discipline. Whether in meetings or strategic planning, the Blue Hat ensures that creativity, analysis, and emotion are all given their time—resulting in coherent, actionable, and thoughtful outcomes.</strong></p>

<!-- White Hat -->

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h2>The White Hat</h2>
    <p><strong>The White Hat is all about information. When entrepreneurs wear this hat, they focus strictly on what is known, what data is available, and what information is missing or needed. It encourages a neutral and objective viewpoint, removing emotion and judgment from the discussion. This hat is used to collect facts, analyze data, identify trends, and ask: What do we know for sure? What is still unknown? By grounding decisions in verified information and acknowledging gaps in knowledge, the White Hat sets the foundation for informed and rational problem-solving.</strong></p>

<!-- Red Hat -->
<div class="row align-items-center flex-md-row-reverse about-block">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h2>The Red Hat</h2>
    <p><strong>The Red Hat allows entrepreneurs to express their gut feelings, emotions, and instincts without needing justification or evidence. It's about acknowledging that emotions play a vital role in decision-making and recognizing emotional reactions in oneself and others. This hat is useful when considering how others might emotionally respond to a new idea, product, or decision. It gives space to insights that may not yet be fully formed but are still important. By legitimizing feelings as part of the process, the Red Hat provides a human dimension that often reveals motivations, concerns, and cultural undercurrents.</strong></p>

<!-- Black Hat -->
<div class="row align-items-center about-block">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h2>The Black Hat</h2>
    <p><strong>Wearing the Black Hat means thinking carefully and critically. Entrepreneurs use this hat to identify potential risks, obstacles, and weaknesses in their plans. It fosters realistic thinking and forces one to ask tough questions: What could go wrong? What are the possible downsides? This hat helps prevent mistakes, overconfidence, and poor judgment by bringing a sober perspective. Although sometimes seen as negative, the Black Hat is essential for creating robust, risk-aware strategies. It challenges ideas constructively, ensuring that enthusiasm is balanced with caution and that solutions are tested for practicality and sustainability.</strong></p>

<!-- Yellow Hat -->
<div class="row align-items-center flex-md-row-reverse about-block">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h2>The Yellow Hat</h2>
    <p><strong>The Yellow Hat brings a positive, constructive outlook to the table. Entrepreneurs wearing this hat focus on identifying the benefits, advantages, and value of an idea or proposal. It helps uncover opportunities, explore feasibility, and generate energy and optimism around a concept. Instead of merely dreaming, the Yellow Hat asks: How can this succeed? What makes it worthwhile? This mode of thinking is valuable for building momentum, boosting morale, and finding strengths even in early-stage or uncertain ventures. It helps balance the critical perspective of the Black Hat by highlighting what could go right.</strong></p>

<!-- Green Hat -->
<div class="row align-items-center about-block">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h2>The Green Hat</h2>
    <p><strong>The Green Hat is a symbol of innovation and growth. Entrepreneurs use it to generate creative solutions, explore new ideas, and break away from conventional patterns. It encourages lateral thinking, free association, and brainstorming without immediate judgment. With the Green Hat, the question becomes: What else is possible? How can we think differently? This hat thrives on imagination and experimentation, making it essential for problem-solving, strategic pivots, and competitive differentiation. It pushes boundaries, cultivates curiosity, and is particularly valuable during early development or when a fresh perspective is urgently needed.</strong></p>
