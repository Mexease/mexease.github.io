    const toolDescriptions = {
  LeanCanvas: "Lean Canvas is a one-page business plan that helps you deconstruct your idea into key assumptions. It replaces elaborate business plans with a concise overview that's easy to iterate on and communicate. It focuses on problems, solutions, key metrics, and competitive advantages, enabling startups and entrepreneurs to map out their business models quickly. By using Lean Canvas, teams can prioritize what's essential, validate assumptions faster, and present ideas clearly to investors, partners, and teammates without getting lost in lengthy documentation.",
  
  Value: "The Value Proposition helps define the value you bring to your customers. It aligns product features with customer needs and identifies what differentiates you from competitors. This tool ensures that you're solving real problems that matter to your audience, and helps you position your offering in a way that resonates. By identifying pains, gains, and jobs to be done, you can tailor your messaging and product development to deliver real, measurable value — increasing customer satisfaction, loyalty, and market fit.",
  
  Idiot: "This tool outlines how to give and receive feedback simply and effectively. It emphasizes being specific, kind, and actionable — helping teams grow without confusion or conflict. It encourages building a culture of openness, where feedback is a tool for growth rather than criticism. By following clear steps and language, teams can avoid misunderstandings and defensiveness, creating an environment where constructive dialogue thrives and individuals feel supported in their development.",
  
  Gremlin: "The Gremlin represents internal or external doubts, fears, or blockers. Identifying and naming the 'Gremlin' helps teams overcome limiting beliefs that hinder creativity. By bringing hidden fears into the open, teams can address them directly and reduce their influence. The Gremlin may show up as imposter syndrome, perfectionism, or fear of rejection — recognizing these patterns allows for healthier decision-making, more confident ideation, and stronger collaboration overall.",
  
  VOJ: "VOJ stands for 'Voice of Judgment' — that little inner critic that stops ideas before they grow. Learn to silence the VOJ during brainstorming to unlock more fearless creativity. The VOJ can kill ideas before they take shape by labeling them as unrealistic or foolish. This tool trains teams to delay judgment, encouraging free flow of ideas without censorship. Later, critical thinking can be reintroduced in a controlled way, ensuring innovation isn’t stifled prematurely by fear or self-doubt.",
  
  FFOE: "FFOE stands for Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. It’s a set of metrics to evaluate the strength and variety of your creative ideas — the more balanced, the better! Fluency is the number of ideas, flexibility is how varied they are, originality measures uniqueness, and elaboration reflects detail. FFOE helps teams not only generate more ideas but also track their quality and range, creating a stronger foundation for innovation and decision-making.",
  
  Failure: "This tool helps teams reframe failure as an opportunity to learn. It encourages embracing mistakes, reflecting constructively, and iterating with purpose. By normalizing failure as part of the creative process, teams can take more risks and test bold ideas without fear. The tool promotes psychological safety and growth mindset — key ingredients for innovation. Debriefing after setbacks helps extract insights, improve resilience, and ensure smarter moves in future attempts.",
  
  Presenting: "Effective presenting is about being clear and concise. This tool helps you simplify your message — remembering that shorter is often stronger and clarity beats complexity. It guides you to know your audience, focus on the core message, and use visuals and storytelling effectively. Good presentation isn't just about slides — it's about confidence, pacing, and connection. This tool helps you craft impactful narratives that persuade, inspire, and stick with your listeners long after you've finished speaking."
