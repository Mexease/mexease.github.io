    greatIdeas: "Great ideas often begin with observing the world around you—watch how people interact with products, services, and environments. Listen to complaints, notice inefficiencies, and ask “what if?” Great ideas solve real problems or tap into unmet needs. Look outside your field for inspiration; sometimes the best innovations are crossovers from unrelated industries. Stay curious, open-minded, and willing to explore odd or unconventional paths. Great ideas aren’t just about originality—they’re about relevance, value, and the ability to create meaningful change for people or systems.",

    reverse: `Reverse Brainstorm:
Come up with ideas that create or worsen the problem statement you have. Then flip those ideas into how you can make the problem not as bad or better.
Example:
How can we use office hours more efficiently with Friedman?
Reverse: How can we ensure that no one gets anything done from Friedman’s office hours?
Then flip that reverse idea to generate potential improvements.`,

    c4: `C4 Brainstorming:
Start with this line - How can I make ______ more ______?
We use this to come up with ideas that are way outside the box in the area of discovery. These are the ideas that no one has tried before or even thought of.

Example convergence questions:
- Which of these are novel ideas? – 56 ideas left
- Which of these will make my friends laugh? – 33 ideas left
- Which of these take me out of my comfort zone? – 23 ideas left
- Which of these are attainable? – 13 ideas left
- Which of these will be noticed in a picture? – 9 ideas left
- Which of these has no one done before? – 2 ideas left
- Which of these might get me in trouble? – 1 (e.g., hit a flaming baseball on fire)`,

    random: `Random Entry:
When you want to produce random stimuli.
Example:
When you're in a coffee shop with your team, use only what’s around you—tables, drinks, people, sounds—to spark ideas. Do it fast. Set a timer. 1-2-3 go!
Rapid-fire creativity in a short burst.`,

    lotus: `Lotus Blossom:
The Lotus Blossom technique helps you break down one core problem by surrounding it with 8 quick ideas. Each of those ideas then becomes the center of its own ‘flower,’ expanding into even more possible solutions. This method helps you think wider and deeper, revealing creative paths you might not have seen at first.

Reflection questions:
- What hidden ideas or patterns can I see once everything is mapped out?
- How does this method push me to think beyond the obvious solution?
- Which ideas feel strong on their own — and which connect to or strengthen others?
- What surprises me about where the best ideas came from?
- How does organizing thoughts this way help me communicate or act on them better?`,

    provocation: `Provocation:
- State a provocation — something unexpected or exaggerated (e.g., “What if my dog could talk?”).
- Suspend judgment — don’t dismiss it, no matter how unrealistic it sounds.
- Explore possibilities — ask “What would have to be true for this to work?” or “How could this spark a useful idea?”
- Extract value — use the new thinking to generate practical ideas or directions.`,

    scamper: `SCAMPER:
The name SCAMPER is an acronym for seven techniques:
- (S)ubstitute: What part of the process can be substituted?
- (C)ombine: What ideas, steps, or processes can be combined?
- (A)dapt: What can we adapt to improve the solution?
- (M)odify: How can we modify or magnify elements of the solution?
- (P)ut to another use: What else can it be used for?
- (E)liminate: What can be removed or simplified?
- (R)everse: What happens if we reverse or rearrange the process?

Questions to spark thinking:
- Can we substitute the current device for a better one?
- Can the project time or place be replaced?
- Where else could you sell the product?
- Could we use another alternative of X?
- Can we replace the process with a simpler one?`
